## Introduction ##

This guide walks the user through creating a *flat* network within Quantum/Neutron in Openstack (Grizzly). Throughout the guide, Quantum and Neutron may be used interchangeably.

## Before You Start ##

This walkthrough assumes that the networking infrastructure is in place and that the nodes are reachable from an outside host. Configuration examples of the gear below will be provided.

The lab I am using is composed of the following gear:

* One controller node (Dell R710)
* One compute node (Dell R710)
* Gateway device (Cisco ASA 5510)
* Switch (Cisco 2960S)
* Openstack (Grizzly) has been installed on Controller and Compute nodes.
